Documentation for the initial downloading of all existing Magic: the Gathering cards as of May 5, 2020.

Step 1: Create cards table and populate it using the magicthegathering api
The structure for the cards table is in the schema.sql file.
The data insertion process was handled by the populateCards.js script.

Step 2: Create a map/lookup table that links the setName given by mtg api to the setName given by the tcg api.
This was a manual process. TCG groups setNames differently in how they name promo cards, prerelease cards, Commander sets, etc.
The structure for tcg_set_names is in the schema.sql file.
The db table was created via importing a csv file.

Step 3: Create a cards_unqiue table that filters out duplicate entries from cards table
The structure for the cards_unqiue table is in the schema.sql file.

Step 4: Create a cards2 table that contains that has the tcg_set_lookup name and other tcg related variables like price and name
The structure for cards2 is in the schema.sql file.

Step 5: Create a cards_error table for cases where the card is not in the tcg database or if there are multiple versions of the card.
The structure for cards_error is in the schema.sql file.

Step 6: Update cards2 with TCG prices
The data insertion process was handled by the updateCardsWithTCGPrices.js script.

Step 7: Create a cards_error2 table to enable handling of cards with more than one product id
The structure for cards_error2 is in the schema.sql file.

Step 8: Handle cards that returned more than one product id when making a tcg api search request. Descriptions on why the tcg api can return multiple results for a given search result are elaborated on in the handleMultipleProductIds script. Insert cards into multiple_cards table.
The structure for the multiple_cards table is in the schema.sql file.
The handleMultipleProductIds.js script populates the multiple_cards table.

Step 9: DELETE FROM cards2 WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM card_errors);

Step 10: Merge cards2 and multiple_cards together to create the final table: card.
The structure for the "card" table is in the schema.sql file.
